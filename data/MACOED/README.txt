This is a brief guide for using the simulated datasets.



The datasets are generated by the software GAMETES_2.0 (Urbanowicz, et al., 2012). The filenames are according to certain rules. Take "00.1600.0.antesnp100.txt" for a example. "00" corresponds to the number of penetrance table; "1600" corresponds to the samplesize; "0" corresponds to the number of datasets which share the same penetrance table; "antesnp100" corresponds to the snpsize For the genotype states, 0, 1 and 2 correspond to the homozygous major allele, heterozygous allele and homozygous minor allele respectively. For disease states, 0 and 1 represent control and case respectively.
